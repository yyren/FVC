# Procedures of both Comparing and Ploting figures
We released our protocal for comparing different machine learning methods in imbalanced data, including building training data with 5 different methods, training with 6 machine learning methods, comparing and ploting the results related in FVC study<br>

It is freely available for academic use, please cite the paper FVC if you use them.<br>

Introduction
------------
### Comparing
Please found the protocal of comparison used in FVC study.<br>

All the procedures of comparison can be found in the notebook 'Steps_for_comparing.ipynb'.<br>

Scripts used in the comparison can be found in the folder 'Scripts_used_in_comparison'


### Plot figures
Please found the protocal of ploting pictures used in the FVC manuscript. These figures are futher typesetted using the illustrator.<br>

All the procedures of plotting can be found in the notebook 'Steps_for_plotting_manuascript_figures.ipynb'.<br>
